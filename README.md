# IPFS Blogging Engine âš¡

## Synopsis

The **IPFS Blogging Engine** and **Render Machine** (built to render blog page from JSON file) serves as the foundation for a Web3.0 blog site and has the ability to scale into a Web3.0 and blockchain-based CMS (Content Management System). It allows users to create a blog page with a simple user interface and then compile all of the blog page's components and uploaded contents into a JSON file. The JSON file will then be deployed and stored on the **IPFS (Interplanetary File System)**, which is a distributed file system, with the help of **[Web3.storage](web3.storage)** and **[Pinata](pinata.cloud)**. Users can now render, display and share their blog page simply by utilising the Render Machine and the CID obtained when the blog page was created. The required JSON file will be fetched from IPFS and parsed into various components, resulting in a fully-designed blog page.
