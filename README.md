# IPFS Blogging Engine âš¡

## Synopsis

The IPFS Blogging Engine serves as the foundation for a Web3.0 blog site and has the ability to scale into a Web3.0 and blockchain-based CMS (Content Management System). It allows users to create a blog page with a simple user interface and then compile all of the blog page's components and uploaded content into a JSON file. The JSON file will then be deployed and stored on the IPFS (Interplanetary File System), which is a distributed file system, with the help of Web3.storage and Pinata. Users can now render, display and share their blog page simply by utilising the Render Machine and the CID obtained when the blog page was created. The required JSON file will be fetched from IPFS and parsed into various components, resulting in a fully-designed blog page.

4. After [Web3.storage](web3.storage) returned a CID, additional pinning of content (using CID) will be done via [Pinata](pinata.cloud)
5. The CID obtained from [Web3.storage](web3.storage) returned to the user
5. User can now render the blog page with Render Machine by using the CID
6. The relevant JSON file is fetched from IPFS when user request
